# In this file, you can define abstract theme references that you want to access
# in your CSS or code. If you're making a theme for a particular app, you may be
# requested by the app authors to include some abstract structures here. If not,
# you can safely ignore this section. Note that abstract structures can be
# referenced in the JS code, but not in other YML sections in the theme.

# Below is an example of abstract structure. If an app developer asks theme
# authors to include border styles for the names 'primary' and 'thick', the
# structure below would fulfill that requirement and ensure the app is themed.
# borders:
#   primary:
#     borderWidth: 1
#     borderColor: sampleColor
#     borderStyle: solid
#   thick:
#     borderWidth: sm
#     borderColor: sampleColor
#     borderStyle: dashed
