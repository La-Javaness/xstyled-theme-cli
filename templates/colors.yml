# Named colors are usable throughout your theme, and always stay the same. They
# can be used as values for foreground and background colors below.
#
# In your `theme.js` file, named colors will be added as-is. Background colors
# will also be added, with the format `bg-{name}`. Foreground colors will be added
# with the format `fg-{name}-on-{backgroundName}`, for each defined background.
# This gives you a predictable way to access any color definition in your code.
#
# On top of that, foreground colors will adjust their value based on the current
# background in the DOM, through the use of the `OnBackground` component provided
# in the `theme` folder.
#
# If you want to switch your whole app to another background yourself, know that
# theme files are also generated where foregrounds match the color of a specific
# background. For instance, if you have a 'dark' background, `OnDark.js` can be
# used to apply as a theme to apply that background.
